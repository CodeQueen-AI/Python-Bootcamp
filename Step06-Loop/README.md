# Python Loops 🔄

**Definition:**  
Loops in Python are used to execute a block of code repeatedly until a certain condition is met ✅



## 1. For Loop 🔁  
- Repeats a block of code for a fixed number of iterations.  
- Can iterate over a sequence like a list, tuple, string, dictionary, or set.  



## 2. While Loop ⏳  
- Repeats a block of code as long as a condition is true.  



## 3. Break Statement 🛑  
- Terminates the loop prematurely when a certain condition is met.  



## 4. Continue Statement ⏭️  
- Skips the current iteration and moves to the next iteration.  



## 5. Pass Statement ➖  
- Does nothing and is used as a placeholder inside loops.  


## 6. Nested Loop 📂  
- A loop inside another loop.  
- Useful for multi-dimensional iterations.  



## 7. Loop with Else 🔚  
- The `else` block runs after the loop completes normally.  
- Does not run if the loop is terminated by a `break` statement.  



## 8. Iteration in Loops 🔎  
- **String Iteration:** Loop through characters of a string.  
- **List Iteration:** Loop through elements of a list.  
- **Tuple Iteration:** Loop through elements of a tuple.  
- **Dictionary Iteration:** Loop through keys and values of a dictionary.  
- **Set Iteration:** Loop through elements of a set.  



✨ Loops are essential for **repeating tasks efficiently in Python** 🚀
