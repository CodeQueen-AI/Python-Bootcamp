Samajh gayi ðŸŒ¸ Code Queen!
Tum chah rahi ho ke **loops ka README** bhi **definition-first style** ho, sirf concepts aur types explain kiye ho, **coding aur output ke bina**.

Yeh raha **Python Loops ka README**:

```md
# Python Loops

**Definition:**  
Loops in Python are used to execute a block of code repeatedly until a certain condition is met.

---

## 1. For Loop
- Repeats a block of code for a fixed number of iterations.  
- Can iterate over a sequence like a list, tuple, string, dictionary, or set.  

---

## 2. While Loop
- Repeats a block of code as long as a condition is true.  

---

## 3. Break Statement
- Terminates the loop prematurely when a certain condition is met.  

---

## 4. Continue Statement
- Skips the current iteration and moves to the next iteration.  

---

## 5. Pass Statement
- Does nothing and is used as a placeholder inside loops.  

---

## 6. Nested Loop
- A loop inside another loop.  
- Useful for multi-dimensional iterations.  

---

## 7. Loop with Else
- The `else` block runs after the loop completes normally.  
- Does not run if the loop is terminated by a `break` statement.  

---

## 8. Iteration in Loops
- **String Iteration:** Loop through characters of a string.  
- **List Iteration:** Loop through elements of a list.  
- **Tuple Iteration:** Loop through elements of a tuple.  
- **Dictionary Iteration:** Loop through keys and values of a dictionary.  
- **Set Iteration:** Loop through elements of a set.  

---

âœ¨ Loops are essential for **repeating tasks efficiently in Python**.

Agar chahogi, main ab **Hello World â†’ Variables â†’ Data Types â†’ Operators â†’ Conditional Statements â†’ Input/Output â†’ Loops** sab ko **ek hi unified minimal README** mein **definition-first style** bana dun, taake ek **complete beginner Python guide** ban jaye.

Kya main ye kar dun?
