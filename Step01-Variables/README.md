Got it Code Queen ðŸŒ¸!
Iâ€™ll make you a **README.md** file in a clean and beginner-friendly way. You can put it in your project folder.

# Hello World & Variables in Python

This project is a simple introduction to Python programming.  
It covers two basic concepts:

1. **Printing "Hello World"** â€“ the first step in learning any programming language.
2. **Using Variables** â€“ storing and printing values.

---

## Code Example

```python
# Hello World
print('Hello World!')

# Variables 
city = 'Karachi'
is_hot = 'True'
print(city, is_hot)
````

---

## Explanation

* `print('Hello World!')`
  â†’ Displays **Hello World!** on the screen.

* `city = 'Karachi'`
  â†’ Creates a variable named **city** and stores the value **Karachi**.

* `is_hot = 'True'`
  â†’ Creates a variable named **is\_hot** and stores the value **True** (as text).

* `print(city, is_hot)`
  â†’ Displays both variables together.

## Output

```
Hello World!
Karachi True
```

---

âœ¨ This is a beginner-friendly example to understand the basics of Python.

```

Do you want me to also add **steps to run the code** (like how to run it with `python filename.py`), or keep it this simple?
