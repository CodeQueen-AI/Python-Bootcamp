# Python Operators ⚡


## 1. Arithmetic Operators ➕➖✖️➗

- `+` Addition → Adds numbers.  
- `-` Subtraction → Subtracts numbers.  
- `*` Multiplication → Multiplies numbers.  
- `/` Division → Divides numbers (gives float).  
- `%` Modulus → Gives remainder.  
- `**` Exponent → Power (e.g., 10**2 = 100).  
- `//` Floor Division → Division result without decimals.  



## 2. Assignment Operators 📝

- `=` Assigns a value.  
- `+=` Add & assign.  
- `-=` Subtract & assign.  
- `*=` Multiply & assign.  
- `/=` Divide & assign.  
- `%=` Modulus & assign.  
- `**=` Power & assign.  
- `//=` Floor divide & assign.  


## 3. Comparison Operators 🔍

- `==` Equal to  
- `!=` Not equal  
- `>` Greater than  
- `<` Less than  
- `>=` Greater than or equal to  
- `<=` Less than or equal to  



## 4. Bitwise Operators 💡

- `&` AND → Sets bit to 1 if both are 1.  
- `|` OR → Sets bit to 1 if any is 1.  
- `^` XOR → Sets bit to 1 if only one is 1.  
- `~` NOT → Inverts bits.  
- `<<` Left shift → Shifts bits left.  
- `>>` Right shift → Shifts bits right.  



## 5. Identity Operators 🆔

- `is` → True if both variables point to the same object.  
- `is not` → True if they are different objects.  



## 6. Logical Operators 🤔

- `and` → True if both are true.  
- `or` → True if at least one is true.  
- `not` → Reverses result.  



## 7. Membership Operators 📦

- `in` → True if element exists.  
- `not in` → True if element does not exist.  



## 8. Relational Operators ⚖️

- `==` Equal  
- `!=` Not equal  
- `>` Greater  
- `<` Less  
- `>=` Greater or equal  
- `<=` Less or equal
