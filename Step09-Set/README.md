# Python Sets and Frozensets

**Definition:**  
A set in Python is an unordered collection of unique elements.  
A frozenset is an immutable version of a set, meaning it cannot be changed after creation.

---

## 1. Creating a Set
- Use curly braces `{}` or the `set()` function.  
- Elements must be unique; duplicates are automatically removed.  

---

## 2. Accessing Elements
- Sets are unordered, so indexing is not possible.  
- Elements can be accessed by looping or converting the set into a list.  

---

## 3. Adding Elements
- **add()** â†’ Add a single element.  
- **update()** â†’ Add multiple elements.  

---

## 4. Removing Elements
- **remove()** â†’ Remove a specific element; raises an error if not found.  
- **discard()** â†’ Remove a specific element; does not raise an error if not found.  
- **pop()** â†’ Remove and return a random element.  
- **clear()** â†’ Remove all elements.  

---

## 5. Set Operations
- **Union (|)** â†’ Combines elements from two sets.  
- **Intersection (&)** â†’ Elements common to both sets.  
- **Difference (-)** â†’ Elements in one set but not in the other.  
- **Symmetric Difference (^)** â†’ Elements in either set, but not in both.  

---

## 6. Membership Test
- **in** â†’ Check if an element exists in the set.  
- **not in** â†’ Check if an element does not exist in the set.  

---

## 7. Set Methods
- **len()** â†’ Number of elements in the set.  
- **copy()** â†’ Returns a shallow copy of the set.  
- **isdisjoint()** â†’ Returns True if two sets have no elements in common.  
- **issubset()** â†’ Checks if a set is a subset of another.  
- **issuperset()** â†’ Checks if a set contains all elements of another.  

---

## 8. Frozenset
- An immutable set that cannot be modified.  
- Useful when a set needs to remain constant or be used as a dictionary key.
