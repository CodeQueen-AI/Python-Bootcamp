# Python Conditional Statements

**Definition:**  
Conditional statements are used to make decisions in Python by running code only when certain conditions are true.

## 1. If-Else Statement
- **if** â†’ Runs a block of code if the condition is true.  
- **else** â†’ Runs a block of code if the condition is false.  

---

## 2. If Statement
- Runs only when the condition is true.

## 3. If-Elif-Else Statement
- **if** â†’ First condition is checked.  
- **elif** â†’ Additional conditions are checked if the first is false.  
- **else** â†’ Runs when none of the conditions are true.

## 4. Nested If
- An `if` statement inside another `if`.  
- Useful for checking multiple conditions step by step.
